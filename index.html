<p>Mockito encourages standard best practices in unit testing and design in general, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mockito does not have a provision for mocking static methods because Mockito encourages object oriented design and dependency injection over procedural code.</li>
<li>Mockito does not have a provision for mocking private methods because public methods should be black boxes and from the standpoint of testing private methods don’t exist.</li>
<li>Mockito packages and encourages the usage of Hamcrest Matchers, which will be covered in subsequent tutorials.</li>
<li>Mockito encourages adherence to the Law of Demeter and does not encourage mocking chained methods.</li>
<li>You should not stub or verify on a mock which is shared between different threads. You may call the methods of a shared mock, however.</li>
<li>You can’t verify the toString() method of a mock, due to the fact that it may be called by the test environment itself, making verification impossible.</li>
<li>If your test cases use the Given When Then notation you can use the stubbing methods from org.mockito.BDDMockito so that when(mock.method()).thenReturn(something) becomes given(mock.method()).willReturn(something) as it will read nicely in your test format.</li>
<li>It is possible to use Mockito without the Mockito annotations, however it is much easier and neater to use the annotations so that is what we will do in these tutorials.</li>
<li>You can ‘spy’ on any class, including the class under test if your testing requires that you modify the behaviour of a particular method of the class for the purposes of the test. Mockito explicitly recommends that spies should be only used carefully and occasionally, for instance when constrained by dealing with legacy code. This will be covered in a future tutorial.</li>
<li>In the event that the real call into a spied method could generate an error condition or cannot be called for some other reason Mockito recommends using the do* family of methods for stubbing. This will be covered in a future tutorial.</li>
<li>Mockito will allow you to use argument matchers in place of real arguments with the limitation that if one argument uses a matcher, all must use matchers. Argument matchers will be covered in a later tutorial but should probably be used sparingly.</li>
<li>Mockito provides a verifyNoMoreInteractions() method to verify that a particular mock has no more interactions but recommends that it is used very sparingly and only when appropriate.</li>
<li>Mockito provides the Answer interface to allow for stubbing with callbacks, however it recommends against using it and encourages you to do simple stubbing using the thenReturn() and doThrow() methods. We will cover Answers in a later tutorial.</li>
<li>If using ArgumentCaptor for argument validation you should use it only in the verification phase, and not the stubbing phase. ArgumentCaptor will be covered in a future tutorial.</li>
<li>Mockito recommends to use Partial Mocks very carefully, mainly when dealing with legacy code. Well designed code should not require the use of partial mocks.</li>
<li>Mockito provides a reset() method for resetting your mock in the middle of a test method, however it recommends against using it as it is a code smell that your test may be overly long and complex.</li>
<li>There are more features and practices, but these are the main ones which Mockito tells you to watch out for. We will cover all of the above and more in depth in the coming tutorials.</li>
</ul>
